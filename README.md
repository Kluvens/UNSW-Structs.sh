## Setup Instructions
Note: this is using **node.js v14.17.0**.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/csesoc/Structs.sh.git
```

### Automatic Setup [Experimental]
This may only work on Linux environments.
```bash
# After cloning the repo, run the following in the root directory
sh structs.sh --setup
```
Follow the prompts and everything should be ready to go.

### Manual Setup

```bash
# After cloning the repo, run the following in the root directory
npm --prefix ./install ./client install
npm --prefix ./install ./server install
```

## Running Structs
From the root directory, you can use the Structs.sh CLI tool:
```bash
sh structs.sh --frontend     # Starts the frontend development server on port 3000
sh structs.sh --backend      # Starts the backend development server on port 8080
```

Alternatively, you may run the npm start script from the `client` and `server` directories.
```bash
# In the `client/` directory:
npm start

# In the `server/` directory:
npm start
```

# Guidelines

## Getting Started With Backend Development



## Getting Started with the Visualiser 

Familiarise yourself with the [visualiser project directory structure](#visualiser-project-directory-structure). One important idea about the way this project is structured is that it is basically a standard React codebase, **except** the visualiser's source code in `visualiser-scripts` is totally standalone from the React codebase. The reasons for structuring it this way are:  
- To ensure that whatever we build can be readily migrated into our primary React frontend codebase. 
    - Keeping the visualiser source code free from React means we won't be being forced into programming in the paradigm encouraged by the framework (eg. React encourages writing [declarative code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33655534/difference-between-declarative-and-imperative-in-react-js), meaning that imperative animation code can't be written without frequent use of hooks - which quickly becomes unmaintainable).
- To take advantage of the toolchain set up by `create-react-app`. This means we can easily access a great development environment that we're all used to, including features like hot-reloading and modern JavaScript syntax (eg. `import`/`export`, `class`, `async`/`await`, etc.).

Suppose we want to implement a `search` operation for linked lists. The steps to this (very roughly, for now) are:

1. In `App.tsx`, Add an `<input id="searchValue" ... />` element and a `<button id="searchButton">Search</button>` element
2. In `controller.js`, add an event handler function and bind that event handler to the button you added. User the other event handlers in `controller.js` as a reference. 
3. In the `createSequence` function in `createSequence.js`, add another `else-if` block and write the algorithm for generating the sequence of animation objects (which will later be stepped through by anime.js). 
    - Note: In doing this, you are also defining the 'style' for each animation step *imperatively*.
        - To see what properties you can style with Anime.js, see [here](https://animejs.com/documentation/#cssProperties). In general, anything you can style with CSS (eg. height, width, colour, position, scale, etc.) can be animated
    - Idea: In the future, defining the styling declaratively could be more flexible and readable (eg. rather than `translateX: '+=100'`, you would just write something like `action: shiftRight`). This would allow the animation sequence generator to be made more independent from the styling of the animation (in a similar way to how CSS is independent to HTML)

## Good Collaborative Coding Practices

### Git Guideline

<details>
    <summary>Git contribution guidelines</summary>

-   Have one branch per feature. Name the branch according to the name convention `<initials>/<feature-name>`, for example, `JS/dashboard` for John Smith
-   Commit frequently with short and meaningful messages
-   When ready to merge into master, first merge master into your branch and deal with conflicts on YOUR branch
-   Open a pull request merging your branch into master
    1. Click `Pull requests` on the top toolbar of this page
    2. Set the base repo to be `csesoc/Structs.sh`
    3. Set the branch you want to merge into master
    4. Click `Create pull request`. You'll be prompted to add a description afterwards
    5. Once the pull request is opened, someone else must approve it
    6. Once approved, it'll be merged into master!
</details>

### Style Guidelines 

Based on <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react">Airbnb's official React style guide</a>.

<details>
<summary>Files and naming</summary>
<p>

-   One component per file

-   Prefer functional components over class components

    -   They're easier to test
    -   Less code, hence easier to read and maintain
    -   Possible performance boost in future versions of React
    -   Only use class components when there's complex internal state

-   Use `.jsx` extension for React components and `.js` for every other file

    -   If using TypeScript, then use `.tsx` and `.ts`

-   Naming
    -   `PascalCase` for React components
        -   Give it the same name as the filename. Eg. for `LinkedList.jsx`, name the React component inside to be `LinkedList`
    -   `camelCase` for everything else

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Indentation</summary>
<p>

-   Splitting up long prop lines:

    ```javascript
    <Foo superLongParam="bar" anotherSuperLongParam="baz" />
    ```

-   Conditional rendering:

    ```javascript
    // && operator
    {
        showButton && <Button />;
    }

    // Ternary operator ()
    {
        someConditional ? <Foo /> : <Foo superLongParam="bar" anotherSuperLongParam="baz" />;
    }
    ```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>JSX</summary>
<p>

-   Spacing

    ```javascript
    // Very bad
    <Foo      bar={ baz }    />

    // Good
    <Foo bar={baz} />
    ```

-   Wrap JSX in parentheses
    ```javascript
    return <MyComponent variant="long body" foo="bar" />;
    ```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Components</summary>
<p>

-   Use 'object destructuring' to get prop arguments

    ```js
    // Don't repeat props everywhere :(
    const Input = (props) => {
        return <input value={props.value} onChange={props.onChange} />;
    };

    // Destructure and use the straight values :)
    const Input = ({ value, onChange }) => <input value={value} onChange={onChange} />;
    ```

-   Always set default props so that the component never crashes when you don't pass in a specific prop
    ```js
    const Component = ({
        title: 'Default Title',
        subtitle: 'Generic Subtitle'
    }) => {
        return (
            <div>
                ...
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Styling with SCSS modules</summary>
<p>

Using global CSS/SCSS is an absolute nightmare in a large project because you have name collisions and specificity issues.
With SCSS modules, every classname you define is 'mangled' so that it is always unique and is guaranteed to never
conflict with any other classname in the project.

How this works:

1. Suppose you're working on `LinkedList.jsx`. Add a new file called `LinkedList.module.scss`
2. Write your SCSS code in that file. Remember SCSS is a superset of CSS so you can just write regular CSS.
    ```scss
    .container {
        margin: 10px;
    }
    ```
3. Import the scss module in `LinkedList.jsx` and apply the style like this:

    ```js
    import styles from './LinkedList.module.scss';

    const LinkedList = () => {
        return <div className={styles.container}>...</div>;
    };
    ```
