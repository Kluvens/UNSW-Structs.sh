## Setup Instructions
Note: this is using **node.js v14.17.0**.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/csesoc/Structs.sh.git
```

### Automatic Setup [Experimental]
This may only work on Linux environments.
```bash
# After cloning the repo, run the following in the root directory
sh structs.sh --setup
```
Follow the prompts and everything should be ready to go.

### Manual Setup

```bash
# After cloning the repo, run the following in the root directory
npm --prefix ./install ./client install
npm --prefix ./install ./server install
```

## Running Structs
From the root directory, you can use the Structs.sh CLI tool:
```bash
sh structs.sh --frontend     # Starts the frontend development server on port 3000
sh structs.sh --backend      # Starts the backend development server on port 8080
```

Alternatively, you may run the npm start script from the `client` and `server` directories.
```bash
# In the `client/` directory:
npm start

# In the `server/` directory:
npm start
```

### Data Model

![Data model](./docs/structs-datamodels.drawio.png)

# Guidelines

## Getting Started With Backend Development

The Structs.sh backend server is written in Node.js with TypeScript, using Express as a server framework and a cloud instance of MongoDB on MongoDB's official cloud platform, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas">MongoDB Atlas</a>. 
> Note: if you've done COMP1531, it's helpful to think of Express as the Node.js version of Flask. Both aim to be a very lightweight server framework, and you tend to work with both of them in very similar ways.

Familiarise yourself with the [backend project directory structure](#client-and-server-directory-structure).

- The `.env` file in `server` contains some important environment variables such as the MongoDB connection URI and the server port number. Without the MongoDB connection URI, the server cannot connect to the database and so all reading/writing operations will fail.
- <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> is an <strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction#is_express_opinionated">unopinionated</a></strong> server framework.

### How was the database set up and connected to our backend?

A free-tier instance of MongoDB was created on MongoDB Atlas following their <a href="https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/tutorial/create-new-cluster/">official guide</a>. The server already has the database connection set up - there should be nothing additional you have to do for now. This is done in `server.ts` using the MongoDB connection URI environment variable in `.env`. Usually this string is protected and hidden (because this string contains admin credentials which allows anyone with this string to connect to the database instance and drop everything). For development however, it's more convenient to keep it exposed in our repo.
> Note: the way the database is hooked up to our backend server here is very similar to how you would do it for other DBMSs. If you wanted to set up PostgreSQL, for example, you would spin up a PostgreSQL server somewhere (either locally or on a cloud platform), get a connection URI string, put it in your environment variables file, then configure the server to connect using that URI.

### How are we reading/writing to the database?

There exists an official <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/node/current/">MongoDB Node.js driver</a> which allows Node.js applications to connect to MongoDB and read/write to collections. There are also different drivers for different programming languages.

A common standard, however, is to use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping">ORM</a> library rather than directly use this driver. For Structs.sh, we're using <a href="https://mongoosejs.com/docs/">Mongoose</a>, which is the most popular and well-documented library for interfacing with MongoDB. Like the database drivers, there exists different ORM libraries for different programming languages. If this were a Python + Flask project, for example, we would consider using <a href="https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">PyMongo</a>.

To understand why using ORM is often preferable compared to directly using the official driver, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/448684/why-should-you-use-an-orm">read this</a>. Another great reason to use an ORM library is that it enables the application programmer to write endpoints that affect the database without having in-depth database knowledge.  

### How does MongoDB differ from other DBMSs like PostgreSQL?  [TODO]

MongoDB is a NoSQL database management system (and the most popular one of that category).

### How to implement API endpoints

If you want to implement some endpoints for creating and retrieving `lesson` objects, then you would do the follow (roughly):
1. Add a new file to the `routes` directory, eg. `lesson.ts`. Follow the other files in `routes` as a reference
2. Register the router exported from the new `lesson.ts` routes file to the app in the `routes/index.ts` file. This tells Express to use your endpoints and handlers
3. To implement your endpoints, you may need to define a new database collection. To do this, add a new file in `schemas`, following the other files in that directory as a reference. Setting up Mongoose schemas will automatically result in a new database collection being created  
4. To do read/write operations, add a new file to `database-helpers` and follow the other files there as a reference. 
    - <a href="https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/model.html">Documentation for the database operations you can use on your schemas</a> 
    - Note: You may be working with new types. You can add new interface declarations in `typedefs`. TypeScript is optional so only do this if it helps you and others
5. Implement the endpoints, using functions exported from the files in `database-helper`.

To check if your endpoints do what you think they do, <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/">setting up and using Postman</a> is a great option. Remember to set the HTTP header field `Content-Type: application/json`.

To check if the database operations actually affected the database, you can use the web interface for our MongoDB instance <a href="https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/61220bca0457b11254eb8d4f#clusters">here</a>. A nicer alternative to the web interface is their official desktop GUI application, <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass">MongoDB Compass</a>.

## Getting Started with the Visualiser 

Familiarise yourself with the [visualiser's project directory structure](#visualiser-project-directory-structure). One important idea about the way this project is structured is that it is basically a standard React codebase, **except** the visualiser's source code in `visualiser-scripts` is totally standalone from the React codebase. The reasons for structuring it this way are:  
- To ensure that whatever we build can be readily migrated into our primary React frontend codebase. 
    - Keeping the visualiser source code free from React means we won't be being forced into programming in the paradigm encouraged by the framework (eg. React encourages writing [declarative code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33655534/difference-between-declarative-and-imperative-in-react-js), meaning that imperative animation code can't be written without frequent use of hooks - which quickly becomes unmaintainable).
- To take advantage of the toolchain set up by `create-react-app`. This means we can easily access a great development environment that we're all used to, including features like hot-reloading and modern JavaScript syntax (eg. `import`/`export`, `class`, `async`/`await`, etc.).

Suppose we want to implement a `search` operation for linked lists. The steps to this (very roughly, for now) are:

1. In `App.tsx`, Add an `<input id="searchValue" ... />` element and a `<button id="searchButton">Search</button>` element
2. In `controller.js`, add an event handler function and bind that event handler to the button you added. User the other event handlers in `controller.js` as a reference. 
3. In the `createSequence` function in `createSequence.js`, add another `else-if` block and write the algorithm for generating the sequence of animation objects (which will later be stepped through by anime.js). 
    - Note: In doing this, you are also defining the 'style' for each animation step *imperatively*.
        - To see what properties you can style with Anime.js, see [here](https://animejs.com/documentation/#cssProperties). In general, anything you can style with CSS (eg. height, width, colour, position, scale, etc.) can be animated
    - Idea: In the future, defining the styling declaratively could be more flexible and readable (eg. rather than `translateX: '+=100'`, you would just write something like `action: shiftRight`). This would allow the animation sequence generator to be made more independent from the styling of the animation (in a similar way to how CSS is independent to HTML)

## Good Collaborative Coding Practices

### Git Guideline

<details>
    <summary>Git contribution guidelines</summary>

-   Have one branch per feature. Name the branch according to the name convention `<initials>/<feature-name>`, for example, `JS/dashboard` for John Smith
-   Commit frequently with short and meaningful messages
-   When ready to merge into master, first merge master into your branch and deal with conflicts on YOUR branch
-   Open a pull request merging your branch into master
    1. Click `Pull requests` on the top toolbar of this page
    2. Set the base repo to be `csesoc/Structs.sh`
    3. Set the branch you want to merge into master
    4. Click `Create pull request`. You'll be prompted to add a description afterwards
    5. Once the pull request is opened, someone else must approve it
    6. Once approved, it'll be merged into master!

### Style Guidelines 

Based on <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react">Airbnb's official React style guide</a>.

<details>
<summary>Files and naming</summary>
<p>

-   One component per file

-   Prefer functional components over class components

    -   They're easier to test
    -   Less code, hence easier to read and maintain
    -   Possible performance boost in future versions of React
    -   Only use class components when there's complex internal state

-   Use `.jsx` extension for React components and `.js` for every other file

    -   If using TypeScript, then use `.tsx` and `.ts`

-   Naming
    -   `PascalCase` for React components
        -   Give it the same name as the filename. Eg. for `LinkedList.jsx`, name the React component inside to be `LinkedList`
    -   `camelCase` for everything else

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Indentation</summary>
<p>

-   Splitting up long prop lines:

    ```javascript
    <Foo superLongParam="bar" anotherSuperLongParam="baz" />
    ```

-   Conditional rendering:

    ```javascript
    // && operator
    {
        showButton && <Button />;
    }

    // Ternary operator ()
    {
        someConditional ? <Foo /> : <Foo superLongParam="bar" anotherSuperLongParam="baz" />;
    }
    ```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>JSX</summary>
<p>

-   Spacing

    ```javascript
    // Very bad
    <Foo      bar={ baz }    />

    // Good
    <Foo bar={baz} />
    ```

-   Wrap JSX in parentheses
    ```javascript
    return <MyComponent variant="long body" foo="bar" />;
    ```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Components</summary>
<p>

-   Use 'object destructuring' to get prop arguments

    ```js
    // Don't repeat props everywhere :(
    const Input = (props) => {
        return <input value={props.value} onChange={props.onChange} />;
    };

    // Destructure and use the straight values :)
    const Input = ({ value, onChange }) => <input value={value} onChange={onChange} />;
    ```

-   Always set default props so that the component never crashes when you don't pass in a specific prop
    ```js
    const Component = ({
        title: 'Default Title',
        subtitle: 'Generic Subtitle'
    }) => {
        return (
            <div>
                ...
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Styling with SCSS modules</summary>
<p>

Using global CSS/SCSS is an absolute nightmare in a large project because you have name collisions and specificity issues.
With SCSS modules, every classname you define is 'mangled' so that it is always unique and is guaranteed to never
conflict with any other classname in the project.

How this works:

1. Suppose you're working on `LinkedList.jsx`. Add a new file called `LinkedList.module.scss`
2. Write your SCSS code in that file. Remember SCSS is a superset of CSS so you can just write regular CSS.
    ```scss
    .container {
        margin: 10px;
    }
    ```
3. Import the scss module in `LinkedList.jsx` and apply the style like this:

    ```js
    import styles from './LinkedList.module.scss';

    const LinkedList = () => {
        return <div className={styles.container}>...</div>;
    };
    ```

<details>
<summary>Quotes</summary>
<p>

-   Use double quotes `"..."` for prop passing and `'...'` for everything else

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>General tips</summary>
<p>

-   DRY - 'don't repeat yourself', (ie. don't do what Tim does)
